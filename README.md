# Darius-Introduction
My introductory repository for GitHub.

Hey all! My name is Darius McCoy, a recent graduate of the University of West Georgia! I'm here 
to show my overall progression through front-end development languages via projects. My hobbies is gaming, running, and coding so if anyone wants to talk Cyberpunk 2077, cross country or Java/Python syntax and debug differences I'm always available!
